                  high standard of living, advanced infrastructure, and a
                  skilled workforce. However, Japan grapples with demographic
                  issues, including an aging population and declining birth
                  rate, impacting its labor force and social welfare system.
                  Despite these challenges, Japan remains a vital player in the
                  global economy, fostering international trade, technological
                  advancements, and cultural exports.

                  Post-COVID-19: Japan's economy has been recovering from the
                  impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with efforts to resume
                  economic activities, including the reopening of borders to
                  inbound tourists. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has maintained a
                  highly accommodative monetary policy, which has led to
                  inflation running above its 2% target. Despite higher
                  inflation, the BOJ continues to implement policies aimed at
                  supporting economic growth. Wage growth in Japan has picked
                  up, but it's still lagging behind inflation. The labor market
                  remains tight, with the unemployment rate expected to edge
                  down to 2.4% in 2024. Real GDP is projected to grow by 1.3% in
                  2023 and 1.1% in 2024, mainly driven by domestic demand.
                  Government support, including measures to cope with the energy
                  price shock and increased defense spending, is anticipated to
                  boost consumption and investment.

                <h1>Currency</h1>
                <p>
                  The Japanese currency is the Yen, denoted by the symbol ¥ and
                  the ISO code JPY. The Yen is one of the most traded currencies
                  in the foreign exchange market and plays a significant role in
                  the global economy. The Yen was introduced in 1871, replacing
                  the complex system of the Edo period based on the mon. The New
                  Currency Act of 1871 established the Yen as the new decimal
                  currency, which was a major step towards modernizing the
                  Japanese economy. Japanese banknotes and coins come in various
                  denominations. Banknotes commonly used include ¥1,000, ¥2,000,
                  ¥5,000, and ¥10,000 notes, while coins come in denominations
                  of ¥1, ¥5, ¥10, ¥50, ¥100, and ¥500. The designs often feature
                  prominent Japanese figures, cultural icons, and natural
                  landmarks. The Bank of Japan (BOJ), established in 1882, is
                  responsible for issuing and managing the currency. The value
                  of the Yen is closely watched by economists and traders as it
                  is a major indicator of the health of the Japanese economy. It
                  is also considered a safe-haven currency, often appreciating
                  during times of global economic uncertainty. Exchange Rate
                  Fluctuations: The Yen's exchange rate against other
                  currencies, particularly the US dollar (USD) and the Euro
                  (EUR), is a critical factor in international trade and
                  finance. The Yen has experienced periods of both significant
                  strength and weakness over the years, influenced by various
                  economic and geopolitical factors. Beyond Japan, the Yen is
                  widely used in international transactions and is considered a
                  reserve currency by some countries. Its stability and the size
                  of Japan's economy make it a preferred currency for many
                  international investors and businesses.

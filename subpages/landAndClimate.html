                  Geography and Land Features
                  <!-- (地理) -->
                </h1>
                <p>
                  Japan, an archipelago in East Asia, comprises four main
                  islands—Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku—alongside
                  numerous smaller ones. Dominated by mountains, with over 70%
                  of the land covered in them, Japan is prone to earthquakes and
                  volcanic activity due to its location on tectonic plate
                  boundaries. Mount Fuji stands as a prominent symbol. The
                  climate varies from subarctic in the north to subtropical in
                  the south, influenced by the surrounding seas and Asian
                  continent. This geography, marked by natural beauty and a mix
                  of traditional and modern features, defines Japan's distinct
                  character.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Perhaps most famous geographic feature of Japan is Mount Fuji,
                  an iconic and sacred volcano that is also the highest peak in
                  Japan, although The Japanese Alps, divided into the Northern,
                  Central, and Southern Alps, are another prominent feature
                  offering breathtaking landscapes. In addition, being part of
                  the Pacific ring of Fire means that Japan has numerous other
                  active volcanoes that give rise to an abundance of hot
                  springs. The Shinano River is the longest, and Lake Biwa is
                  the largest freshwater lake, known for its unique ecosystem.
                  These water bodies are crucial for Japan's agriculture and
                  biodiversity. Japan, being an island nation, also boasts many
                  sandy beaches and lesser islands.

                  Japan boasts diverse and lush forests that cover approximately
                  67% of its total land area. These forests exhibit a wide range
                  of ecosystems, from the dense evergreen forests of cedar and
                  cypress trees in the mountains to the deciduous forests found
                  in lower elevations. Together with the country's many mountain
                  ranges, the forests provide an excellent habitat for many
                  diverse habitats and ecosystems. Noteworthy is the extensive
                  Japanese cedar (sugi) and Japanese cypress (hinoki) forests,
                  which play a significant role in the country's timber
                  industry. These wooded landscapes also host a rich array of
                  flora and fauna, including iconic species like the Japanese
                  macaque and the sika deer. Conservation efforts are underway
                  to protect these forests and their biodiversity, recognizing
                  their ecological importance and contribution to Japan's
                  cultural and natural heritage.

                  Japan experiences a diverse climate ranging from subarctic in
                  the north to subtropical in the south. This climatic variety
                  is shaped by the surrounding seas, including the Sea of Japan
                  and the Pacific Ocean, as well as the influence of the Asian
                  continent. Winters can be cold with heavy snowfall in northern
                  regions, while southern areas enjoy milder temperatures.
                  Summers are generally hot and humid nationwide, often
                  accompanied by the rainy season. Typhoons, common in late
                  summer and early autumn, can bring heavy rains and strong
                  winds. This climatic tapestry contributes to the unique
                  seasonal characteristics and weather patterns that define
                  Japan throughout the year.

                  Japan experiences four distinct seasons, each characterized by
                  unique climatic features and cultural significance. Spring, or
                  "haru," is celebrated for its iconic cherry blossoms (sakura),
                  marking a time of renewal and beauty. Summer, or "natsu,"
                  brings warm temperatures and vibrant festivals, with
                  traditional events like Hanabi (fireworks) illuminating the
                  night skies. Autumn, or "aki," is a season of stunning
                  foliage, with maple and ginkgo trees transforming the
                  landscapes into a vivid tapestry of red and gold. Winter, or
                  "fuyu," sees colder temperatures and sometimes heavy snowfall,
                  creating picturesque scenes and providing opportunities for
                  winter sports.

                  Japan's weather patterns, shaped by its geographic location
                  and diverse topography, offer a fascinating glimpse into the
                  country's climatic variability. Winters witness the collision
                  of cold Siberian air and moist Pacific air, leading to
                  significant snowfall along the western coast. Summers are
                  characterized by the East Asian monsoon, coupled with
                  occasional typhoons originating in the Pacific. The shift
                  between seasons introduces a distinct rainy season in early
                  summer, known as "tsuyu" or "baiu." These intricate weather
